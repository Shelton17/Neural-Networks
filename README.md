# Neural-Networks
This repository contains jupyter notebooks, R files and reports that use real examples to describe how convolutional neural networks work. The square root file uses square roots of numbers to show how a model can iterate through training data and come up with accurate and near accurate square roots of numbers in the test data. The effectiveness is also tested by sampling the error rate.


Important Note:
The notebooks are written in a report format therefore code lines are explained as you navigate through the notebook
